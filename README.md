## Middle-Cidate

- I have chosen PHP's Laravel Framework to implement this task.




### Deisgn Pattern

- Design Pattern: Repository Design Pattern


#### Deploy

Deployment this project requires the following steps:

- clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/temmyscope/middlecidate
```

- install dependencies
```sh
composer install
```

- start server
```sh
php artisan serve
``` 

### Endpoint

Sample Request To the Middleware API

- /api/institutions?institution=XXX

sample response
```json

```


### Worthy of Note

- Naturally, I'd prefer to use either Python's FastAPI or Laravel's Octane Frameworks (as they are more optimized for performance) but seeing it's a straightforward task that won't require extra performance gain, I went with the easiest to setup choice


- A Postman Collection (of requests) would be a proper way to document the API
